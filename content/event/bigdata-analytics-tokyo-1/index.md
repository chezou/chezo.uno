summary:
abstract: Using Cloudera Enterprise, it is possible to build and operate an enterprise-grade Hadoop/Spark platform. To make use of big data, what kind of platform is needed, and how do you get the most out of it? From the perspective of data engineering and data science, I will introduce machine learning that uses SQL-on-Hadoop, Spark, and Python.
